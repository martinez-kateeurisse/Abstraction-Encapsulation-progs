#Next, design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five times.
#After each call to the accelerate method ,get the current speed of the car and display it. 
#Then call the brake method five times. 
#After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.

#Import class

#Create car object
#Call the accelerate method (5 times)
    #Get speed (each time)
    #Display speed (each time)
#Call the brake method (5 times)
    #Get speed (each time)
    #Display speed (each time)
